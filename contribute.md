# Git Commit Message Guidelines

We follow these rules for git commit messages:

### Type

Must be one of the following:

- feat: A new feature
- fix: A bug fix
- docs: Documentation only changes
- style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- perf: A code change that improves performance
- test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- chore: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation


### Subject

The subject contains a succinct description of the change:

- use present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
- don't capitalize the first letter
- no dot (.) at the end
